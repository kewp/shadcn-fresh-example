# shadcn-fresh example

this is an example project for using
http://github.com/kewp/shadcn-fresh, a port
of shadcn/ui to fresh (see the repo above for
more on how i did this).

## geting started

just run `deno task start`

## how it was done / doing it your own

1. create a new fresh project the standard way (`deno run -A -r https://fresh.deno.dev`). make sure to include tailwind
2. import `shadcn-fresh`
3. prosper
